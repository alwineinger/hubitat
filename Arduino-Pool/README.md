Arduino ST_Anything Pool Controller (SuperFlo VS) for Hubitat
=======
The goal of this device is to control my Pool Pump (Pentair Superflo VS) + my
[SR Smith Kelo pool lights](https://srsmith.com/en-us/products/pool-lighting/kelo-led-pool-light). The goal is to have buttons to control what speed the pump is running and
optionally, being able to control the lights. The main reason for me to do the
speed was that I could force a higher speed when the pool heater was on (heater
on 40AMP outdoor outlet). Now I have a Hubitat automation that can ensure the
pool speed is on speed 1 when the heater is on.

Requirements
------------
To get started you'll need:
- [LinkNode
  R8](https://www.amazon.com/ESP8266-ESP-01S-Wireless-Development-PlayStation-4/dp/B07FBNZ79T).
If you have an R4, you'll need to [review this
device](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/ST_Anything/tree/master/Arduino/Sketches/ST_Anything_LinkNodeR4_ESP8266WiFi)
and modify it to fit the options of my R8. From some of the pictures below, you'll see
an R4, but I wasn't running ST_Anything/Hubduino on that device, so I don't
have R4 code to share. You'll also need a power supply, or be comfortable dissecting an old USB cable and hardwiring it to your R4 or R8 device. 
- [Arduino](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html)
- [ST_Anything](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/ST_Anything) and
  [Hubduino](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/ST_Anything/tree/master/HubDuino)
- [SuperFlo VS Communication Cable](https://www.polytecpools.com/Pentair-SuperFlo-VS-Communication-Cable_p_9177.html)
- [Pool Lights](https://srsmith.com/media/178718/2018-kelo_manual_0318.pdf)
  (Optional) - Any model that is low voltage and the colors are triggered via
quick on/off/on to cycles to go through the modes/colors. 
- [Temperature Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QL9PLY9/) -
  Optional Temperature Sensor - You can use either
[ST_Anything](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/ST_Anything/blob/master/Arduino/Sketches/ST_Anything_10kThermistor_ESP8266WiFi/ST_Anything_10kThermistor_ESP8266WiFi.ino) using the PS_10KThermistor or [Weewx Pool
Sensor - this has wiring diagrams for both options](https://github.com/bdwilson/weewx-poolsensor). With this sensor and a Wells D1 Mini, I'm using these settings: Bcoefficient: 3950, Thermistor Nominal (@25C): 11000, Series Resistor: 9900. ST_Anything code is available [here](https://github.com/bdwilson/weewx-poolsensor/blob/master/arduino_pool_sensor.ino) - keep in mind this file has settings for a 10K thermistor from [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M1TEFTU/).  

Installation
--------------------

1. Follow the instructions with ST_Anything and get it and it's dependancies
setup in Arduino. Connect your R8 or R4 device an FT232 device or similar that
can be used to program the ESP8266 on the R4 or R8.

2. Install ST_Anything-LinkNodeR8.ino into Arduino and modify the settings for
your wireless network, Hub IP, and config settings below

3. The configuration in LinkNodeR8 code is setup this way:
	- Switch 1 = Speed 1, Switch 2 = Speed 2, Switch 3 = Speed 3. Switch 4 =
	  Quick Clean
    - If you turn on any speed, it turns the other speeds off.
    - Relay Switch 9 is 15 minutes of Quick Clean, Relay Switch 10 is 30
      minutes of Quick Clean; it will turn both of these off when complete but won't turn on any other speeds when done. 
	- Relay Switch 1-8 are configured as timed relay switches to turn the
	  switch on/off/on within 1 second for a certain number of times which in
turn, changes the colors. This is a common design for pool lighting systems.
**If you're not going to wire your lights to this and only want to control
your pool speeds, comment out the relay switches and executors for that
particular relay within the code.**

4. Splice your SuperFlow VS communication wire and wire it according to the
docs below and speeds mentioned above.

Example here is a LinkNode R4

Note: by default on a SuperFlow VS will use external controls if any of the
inputs have signal, otherwise, the pump will follow the schedule on the device.
This worked best for me. If you want only External controls to work, follow
this information. You cannot power on/off the pump via either method.

5. If you are wiring lights, you'll need to tap into your existing power for
your low voltage lights and essentially put a relay inbetween those
connections. Be very careful if you're messing in your pool control or lighting
control box and insure that mains are off at the breaker.

6. Install the rest of
[Hubduino](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/ST_Anything/tree/master/HubDuino)
in Hubitat and it should discover all of
your switches and relayswitches. If everything works, put everything in a
[water-tight box](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BQD3SZV).
